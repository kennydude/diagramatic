# Small port of Eclipse's Draw2D functions

## Why?
To make connecting lines easier and nicer :)

## What's different?
It's just what we need to use Manhattan, nothing more, nothing less.

Also, I didn't put it neatly in directories and some function naming is off to make it work under Vala but I don't really care.

## Can I use it?
Sure, just follow the license the original library is under http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html EPL.

## Requirements

* GLib
* Gee
* valac
